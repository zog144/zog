# Reviewed source population

Archive-mirror can preserve exact upstream source objects selected by image-build without
becoming authoritative for source identity. Image-build remains responsible for choosing
the canonical upstream URL and expected SHA-256. Archive-mirror only acquires, verifies,
retains and serves those declared bytes.

## Manifest contract

Use an immutable JSON manifest:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "pin_set": "2026-10",
  "date": "2026-10-01",
  "sources": [
    {
      "package": "example",
      "source": "release",
      "url": "https://upstream.example/example-1.0.tar.gz",
      "sha256": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
    }
  ]
}
```

`package` and `source` are optional reporting labels. The URL and SHA-256 are the
reviewed source declaration. URLs must be credential-free HTTPS URLs without query or
fragment components. Archive-mirror does not resolve "latest" names or alter a digest
when upstream content changes.

Population is administrative:

```sh
archive-mirror populate-sources /path/to/image-build-source-pins.json
```

For each declaration, archive-mirror first checks the existing `sources` collection by
SHA-256. A verified hit uses no upstream network. A miss fetches the exact canonical URL,
rejects redirects, enforces the configured maximum object size, calculates SHA-256, and
publishes only when the result equals the declared digest. Publication then uses the
normal object-store staging, fsync, atomic rename and database transaction path.

A pin-set identity is immutable with respect to its manifest bytes. Retrying the same
manifest is idempotent. Reusing the identity with different manifest bytes or a different
date fails. The pin set becomes active only after all declarations have matching
catalogue membership.

Release retention explicitly when the reviewed set is no longer active:

```sh
archive-mirror release-source-pin-set 2026-10
archive-mirror prune
```

Managed objects introduced by source population are eligible for pruning only after no
active reviewed pin set, monthly snapshot, or administrative pin references them.
Pre-existing manual imports keep their existing retention class.

## Serving

The existing image-build-compatible route remains supported:

```
GET /collections/sources/archives/SHA256.tar.xz
```

A representation-neutral route serves the identical stored bytes:

```
GET /collections/sources/objects/SHA256
```

Both require the existing `download` authorization for collection `sources`, do not
redirect, and return `X-Archive-SHA256`, `Content-Length`, and a digest ETag. The
generic route uses `application/octet-stream`; the old route keeps its existing XZ
content type and filename for compatibility.

The authenticated collection catalogue includes bounded reviewed-source provenance:
pin-set identity, active state, optional package/source labels and the validated canonical
URL. Arbitrary import metadata is still filtered and bearer credentials are never stored
or exposed.

## Redirect policy

Version 1 rejects every upstream redirect. This is deliberate: the reviewed canonical
URL is the only authorized acquisition target. A future redirect policy, if needed for a
specific upstream, should be separately reviewed rather than silently following arbitrary
3xx responses.

## Ownership boundary

- image-build owns reviewed source declarations, source identity and monthly pin exports;
- archive-mirror owns exact acquisition, durable content-addressed storage, pin-set
  retention and authenticated serving;
- build hosts do not need a remote upload API;
- image-build may still fall back to canonical upstream when no ready archive-mirror has
  the object.
